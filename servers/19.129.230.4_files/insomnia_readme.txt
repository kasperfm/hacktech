-== Insomnia by TeamAnubis86 ==-

TeamAnubis proudly presents the Insomnia virus!
It's still in alpha stage, so it doesn't work on
many systems YET, but when it works, it does the job good!
Right now it works on systems running xkSSH v2.16 or lower.

After Insomnia has been executed the system will shutdown immediatly,
and it overwrites the bootsector!
It's small, it's fast, and it's evil >:]
