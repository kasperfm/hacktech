# HackTech
## Version 0.2.0 Alpha-02

### This game was made in 2007, and only made it to the alpha state!
### After this point, the game were not developed any further.
### Take a look at https://hacktechonline.com if you are into hacker sims.


## Info:
HackTech is a semi-realistic hacking simulation game.
It's primary goal is to make a "virtual internet" where
the player can mess around with some servers ^.^ and complete
missions.


## Note:
This game isn't made to learn people how to crack servers or
how to use exploits. The reason I wrote this game is to make the
player have some fun.


## Hint:
Take a look at your ingame bookmarks, there is a very usefull link from the start.


Enjoy the game! ^_^
